How to Read it

RSI < 30 → the market has been heavily sold. Traders may see this as a “buy” zone.

RSI > 70 → the market has been heavily bought. Traders may see this as a “sell” zone.

RSI around 50 → neutral; no strong trend.

RSI is not a guarantee. Just because RSI > 70 doesn’t mean the price will drop immediately.

It works best in sideways/ranging markets.

For strong trends, RSI can stay overbought or oversold for a long time.
